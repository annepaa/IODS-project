## Start me up! - exercise

I am a pharmacist and I am doing a PhD at the **University of Eastern Finland**. I am working with register-based data on *Parkinson's disease*. I heard about this course from my colleague and I am looking forward to learn a lot about data sciences! I have only a little experience on coding. 

Here is a link to my GitHub repository <https://github.com/annepaa/IODS-project.git>
