## RStudio exercise 5: Dimensionality reduction techniques

```{r}
date()
```
I will read the dataset "human" from the internet link that was given to us.
```{r}
human<-read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2218/datasets/human2.txt",sep=",")
colnames(human)

```
Let's check the summaries of the variables and show graphical overview of the data.
```{r}
#summary
summary(human)

#graphical overview, first I get the libraries
library(GGally)
library(dplyr)
library(corrplot)
ggpairs(human)
cor(human)%>%corrplot()
```
  
Some variables have no correlation.
